This project was hosted on Kaggle as a data science competition for advanced regression methods. The project requirement was to use this dataset which comes with a large number of features to build a linear regression model which predicts a price of a house that is on sale in Ames community, IOWA.

The dataset is sourced from the Ames Assessor's Offoice and contains 82 features (including the target feature) and 2930 observations. Throguhough this project, I've frequently referred to the description file which includes information on all the variables and variable types included in the dataset.
