This project was hosted as a Kaggle competition. The project is focued on advanced regression techniques applied on a dataset with a large number of features. 

The objective is to build a linear regression model that will predict house prices based on a number of features describing various characteristics of a given house in Ames community, IOWA. 

The dataset is sourced from the Ames Assessor's Offoice and contains 82 features (including the target feature) and 2930 observations. Throguhough this project, I've frequently referred to the description file which includes information on all the variables and variable types included in the dataset.
